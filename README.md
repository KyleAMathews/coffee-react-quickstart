coffee-react-quickstart
=======================

Evolving base for creating React applications

Has React/Testing/Sass starter code along with a gulpfile for building.

## Install dependencies

Clone this repo and then after entering the new directory run `npm install` and `bundle install`. This will install the respective NPM and Ruby Gem dependencies.

You'll also need to have cult/gulp installed globally to run the coffeescript gulpfile: `npm install -g gulp cult`

## Building
Run in the root of your directory: `cult watch`

This will watch the src directories and build on changes and placed the built css and js files in the public directory. It'll serve everything in the /public directory at localhost:9000

Default output looks like:
